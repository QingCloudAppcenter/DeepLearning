# The following example allows for the MNIST example (using LeNet) to be
# trained using the caffe docker image instead of building from source.
#
# The GPU-enabled version of Caffe can be used, assuming that nvidia-docker
# is installed, and the GPU-enabled Caffe image has been built.
# Setting the GPU environment variable to 1 will enable the use of nvidia-docker.
# e.g.
#   GPU=1 ./examples/mnist/train_lenet_docker.sh [ADDITIONAL_CAFFE_ARGS]
#
# With any arguments following the script being passed directly to caffe
# when training the network.
#
# The steps that are performed by the script are as follows:
# 1. The MNIST data set is downloaded
#    (see data/mnist/get_mnist.sh)
# 2. An LMDB database is created from the downloaded data
#    (see examples/mnist/create_mnist.sh.
# 3. A caffe network based on the LeNet solver is trained.
#    (see examples/mnist/lenet_solver.prototxt)
#
# For each of these, a step is executed to ensure that certain prerequisites
# are available, after which a command that actually performs the work is
# executed.
#
# In order to provide additional flexibility, the following shell (environment)
# variables can be used to controll the execution of each of the phases:
#
# DOWNLOAD_DATA: Enable (1) or disable (0) the downloading of the MNIST dataset
# CREATE_LMDB: Enable (1) or disable (0) the creation of the LMDB database
# TRAIN: Enable (1) or disable (0) the training of the LeNet networkd.
#
# As an example, assuming that the data set has been downloaded, and an LMDB
# database created, the following command can be used to train the LeNet
# network with GPU computing enabled.
#
# DOWNLOAD_DATA=0 CREATE_LMDB=0 GPU=1 ./examples/mnist/train_lenet_docker.sh
